- en: The world is an interesting place, about this there can be no doubt. We experience
    the world through our senses, which gather data to be processed by our brains.
    Frequently the world is disordered, requiring us to think long and hard to get
    meaning out of things. To ease this process, data can be transformed into other
    forms that are simpler to understand.

- en: This book is about molding data into a form which is more understandable. It
    is about taking some of the richest data sources of our time—social networks—and
    turning their vast array of data into an understandable format. To that effect,
    we make use of the latest in HTML and JavaScript.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Visualizing Data"), *Visualizing Data*, introduces
    us to a world full of ever growing datasets. It also discusses how this river
    of data can be navigated using visualizations as our canoe.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. JavaScript and HTML5 for Visualizations"),
    *JavaScript and HTML5 for Visualizations*, looks at new features in HTML and JavaScript
    that present opportunities for visualizing data. It discusses both canvas and
    Scalable Vector Graphics.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. OAuth"), *OAuth*, examines the often confusing
    OAuth technology and shows how it can be used to delegate authority to our application.
    This is because much of the data on social media sites is private and there might
    be times when we need to get this data.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. JavaScript for Visualization"), *JavaScript
    for Visualization*, looks at Raphaël.js and d3.js which are great JavaScript libraries
    that can reduce the pain involved in building visualizations by hand, which is
    otherwise a time-consuming and error-prone task.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Twitter"), *Twitter*, looks at how to retrieve
    data from Twitter and use it to build a visualization.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Stack Overflow"), *Stack Overflow*, looks
    at how to retrieve the data API of the ever popular Stack Overflow, which presents
    some tantalizing opportunities for visualization that can be used to create an
    interactive graph.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Facebook"), *Facebook*, explores the Facebook
    JavaScript API and how to use it to retrieve data to use as the basis of our next
    visualization. In my mind, the original and still the largest social media network
    on the planet is Facebook.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are very few tools needed to make use of the examples and code in this
    book. You'll need to install node.js ([http://node.org](http://node.org)) which
    is covered in [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Twitter"), *Twitter*. You'll want
    to download d3.js ([http://d3js.org](http://d3js.org)), jQuery ([http://jquery.com](http://jquery.com)),
    and Raphael.js ([http://raphaeljs.com/](http://raphaeljs.com/)). All the demos
    can be viewed in any modern web browser. The code has been tested against Chrome
    but should work on FireFox, Opera, and even Internet Explorer.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for anybody who is excited about data and wants to share that excitement
    with others. Anybody who is interested in data that can be extracted from social
    networks would also find this book interesting. Readers should have a working
    knowledge of both JavaScript and HTML. jQuery is used numerous times throughout
    the book, so readers would do well to be familiar with the basics of that library.
    Some exposure to node.js would be helpful but not necessary.
