    a framework, but now we're going to learn how to install it as a package.

    and delete the `bootstrap` directory. It doesn't matter if your Meteor app is
    running or not (remember, Meteor updates dynamically!). Either start it up and
    then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` or just navigate there if it is already
