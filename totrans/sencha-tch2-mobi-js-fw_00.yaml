- en: Since its initial launch, Sencha Touch has quickly become the gold standard
    for developing rich mobile web applications with HTML5\. Sencha Touch is the first
    HTML5 mobile JavaScript framework that allows you to develop mobile web apps that
    look and feel like native apps on iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, and Windows Phone
    touch-screen devices. Sencha Touch is the world's first application framework
    built specifically to leverage HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the highest level
    of power, flexibility, and optimization. It makes specific use of HTML5 to deliver
    components such as audio and video as well as a localStorage proxy for saving
    data offline. Sencha Touch also makes extensive use of CSS3 in its components
    and themes to provide an incredibly robust styling layer, giving you total control
    over the look of your application.
