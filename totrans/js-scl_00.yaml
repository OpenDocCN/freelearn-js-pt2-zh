- en: Some applications just get it right. These are the exceptions rather than the
    rule. Lots of JavaScript applications get one or two things right, and other things
    very wrong. The things we get wrong are a side effect of the scaling influencers
    that we never considered. This is a book about scaling our frontend architectures
    to meet the quality requirements asked of us. Scaling JavaScript applications
    is an interesting and fun problem. There're so many moving parts—the users, the
    developers, the deployment environments, the browser environments, and the task
    of bringing all of these factors together to form a meaningful user experience.
    What are we scaling, and why? The aim of this book is to help us answer these
    questions.

    from a JavaScript Perspective*, introduces the idea of scalable JavaScript applications
    and what makes them different from other applications that scale.'

    helps us understand that the need to scale helps us design better architectures.'

    explains how the patterns that form the core of our architecture serve as blueprints
    for assembling components.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Component Communication and Responsibilities"),
    *Component Communication and Responsibilities*, explains how components that communicate
    with one another are a scaling constraint. It tells us how features are the result
    of component communication patterns.'

    and Navigation*, elaborates on large-scale web applications with URIs that point
    to resources, and how designs that scale can handle a growing number of URIs.'

    and Defaults*, tells us why users need control over certain aspects of our software.
    And it also explains that scalable application components are configurable.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Load Time and Responsiveness"), *Load Time
    and Responsiveness*, explains how more moving parts means performance degradation
    across the application. This includes making trade-offs that keep our UI responsive,
    while adding new features.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Portability and Testing"), *Portability and
    Testing*, covers writing JavaScript code that''s not tightly coupled with a single
    environment. This includes creating portable mock data and portable tests.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Scaling Down"), *Scaling Down*, explains
    how removing unused or buggy components from applications is essential, if we
    want to scale up in other areas.'

- en: '[Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Coping with Failure"), *Coping with Failure*,
    explains that large-scale JavaScript architectures can''t fall over as a result
    of a bug in one component. This includes how designing with failure in mind is
    the key to achieving scale in a broad number of scenarios.'

    architectural issues in the frontend. There's no prerequisite framework knowledge
    required, however, most of the concepts presented throughout the book are adaptations
    of components found in frameworks such as Backbone, Angular, or Ember. Strong
    JavaScript language skills are required, and all code examples are presented using
    ECMAScript 6 syntax.
