- en: '*JavaScript Promises Essentials* is a practical guide to the new concept of
    promises. It presents a single resource replacing all the scattered information
    out there about the topic. It covers in detail the new standard that will enhance
    the way we do asynchronous programming in JavaScript. The book is a brief, yet
    concise, explanation of the Promises API and its features and how it can be used
    in JavaScript programming. It covers the essentials of JavaScript promises, touching
    on the details that matter the most in your new learning with some very useful
    tips on the different aspects of the topic.'

- en: Promises are for the most part a programming concept and provide a process that
    allows developers to arrange work to be executed on data and values that do not
    yet exist and allows them to deal with those values at an undetermined point in
    the future (asynchronously). It also presents an abstraction to handle the communication
    with asynchronous APIs. Currently, there are ways to achieve asynchronous calling
    in JavaScript through callback, timers, and events, but all come with caveats.
    Promises solve real development headaches and allow developers to handle JavaScript's
    asynchronous operations in a more native manner compared to the traditional approaches.
    Furthermore, promises present a straightforward correspondence between synchronous
    functionality and asynchronous functions, especially at the level of error handling.
    Several libraries have started using promises and now offer a robust implementation
    of promises. You can find promises on the Web in many libraries and also by interacting
    with Node.js and WinRT. Learning the details of promise implementations will help
    you avoid the many problems that arise in the world of asynchronous JavaScript
    and to construct better JavaScript APIs.
