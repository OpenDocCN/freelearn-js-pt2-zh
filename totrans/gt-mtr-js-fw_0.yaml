- en: We live in amazing times. Advances in medicine, communication, physics, and
    all other scientific fields provide us with opportunities to create things that
    were literally impossible to create only a short while ago.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And yet, we aren't easily amazed. We've come to expect wondrous advances, and
    therefore what was once amazing becomes…well…expected. It's a rare thing, indeed,
    to find something that takes us by surprise. Something that renews that childhood
    sense of wonder we all secretly want back, because it was stolen from us.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, prepare to regain some of that wonder. A dedicated group of computer scientists
    who are determined to make something wondrous have created a new JavaScript platform
    called Meteor. You may be thinking, "A new JavaScript platform? That's nothing
    special." And if that's all Meteor was, you'd be correct, but fortunately for
    you, that's not the end of the story.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Meteor is a reactive, simple, and powerful application platform, capable of
    producing sophisticated, robust web applications with just a few lines of code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the context of web applications, it is state-of-the-art. Using established,
    proven development design patterns, Meteor takes all the difficult and mundane
    parts of building a web application and does them all for you. You get to focus
    on building a solid application with all the latest innovations such as reactive
    programming, templates, plugins, and client-side caching/synchronization. You
    get to do all of this without getting bogged down in the usual time-wasting activities,
    such as writing yet-another-database-interface, or learning a new templating engine.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the best part is, it's simple to learn. Amazingly simple. You will see an
    application come to life right before your eyes, and when you look back at the
    number of lines of code it took to create, and compare it to the traditional methods
    of development, you may actually find yourself saying "wow" or "how did they do
    that?"
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will walk you through the major features of Meteor, and show you how
    to create an application from scratch. By the end of the book, you will have created
    a working, useful application, and you will have a solid understanding of what
    makes Meteor different. It may sound like hyperbole, but if you're open to the
    idea that something innovative and unexpected can qualify as amazing, then prepare
    to be amazed!
