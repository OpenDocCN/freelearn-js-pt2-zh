    testing strategy is indispensable. In fact, not writing enough tests is almost
    always a bad idea. It is essential to cover all the non-trivial functionality
    of your code to make sure of the following points:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both these points are very important. Many engineers consider only the first
    point the sole reason to cover your code with enough tests. The most obvious advantage
    of test coverage is to really make sure that the code being pushed to the production
    system is mostly error-free. Writing test cases to smartly cover the maximum functional
    areas of the code generally gives you a good indication about the overall quality
    of the code. There should be no arguments or compromises around this point. It
    is unfortunate though that many production systems are still bereft of adequate
    code coverage. It is very important to build an engineering culture where developers
    think about writing tests as much as they think about writing code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second point is even more important. Legacy systems are usually very difficult
    to manage. When you are working on code written either by someone else or a large
    distributed team, it is fairly easy to introduce bugs and break things. Even the
    best engineers make mistakes. When you are working on a large code base that you
    are unfamiliar with and if there is no sound test coverage to help you, you will
    introduce bugs. As you won't have the confidence in the changes that you are making
    (because there are no test cases to confirm your changes), your code releases
    will be shaky, slow, and obviously full of hidden bugs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will refrain from refactoring or optimizing your code because you won't
    really be sure what changes to the code base would potentially break something
    (again, because there are no test cases to confirm your changes)—all this is a
    vicious circle. It's like a civil engineer saying, "though I have constructed
    this bridge, I have no confidence in the quality of the construction. It may collapse
    immediately or never." Though this may sound like an exaggeration, I have seen
    a lot of high impact production code being pushed with no test coverage. This
    is risky and should be avoided. When you are writing enough test cases to cover
    majority of your functional code and when you make a change to these pieces, you
    immediately realize if there is a problem with this new change. If your changes
    make the test case fail, you realize the problem. If your refactoring breaks the
    test scenario, you realize the problem—all this happens much before the code is
    pushed to production.

    are gaining prominence, especially in **agile methodology**. These are fundamentally
    sound ideas and will help you write robust code—code that you are confident of.
    We will discuss all these ideas in this chapter. You will understand how to write
    good test cases in modern JavaScript. We will also look at several tools and methods
    to debug your code. JavaScript has been traditionally a bit difficult to test
    and debug primarily due to lack of tools, but modern tools make both of these
    easy and natural.

- en: '**Test-driven** **development** (**TDD**) has gained a lot of prominence in
    the last few years. The concept was first proposed as part of the **Extreme Programming**
    methodology. The idea is to have short repetitive development cycles where the
    focus is on writing the test cases first. The cycle looks as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Add a test case as per the specifications for a specific unit of code.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Run the existing suite of test cases to see if the new test case that you wrote
    fails—it should (because there is no code for this unit yet). This step ensures
    that the current test harness works well.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Write the code that serves mainly to confirm the test case. This code is not
    optimized or refactored or even entirely correct. However, this is fine at the
    moment.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rerun the tests and see if all the test cases pass. After this step, you will
    be confident that the new code is not breaking anything.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Refactor the code to make sure that you are optimizing the unit and handling
    all corner cases.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These steps are repeated for all the new code that you add. This is an elegant
    strategy that works really well for the agile methodology. TDD will be successful
    only if the testable units of code are small and confirm only to the test case
    and nothing more. It is important to write small, modular, and precise code units
    that have input and output confirming the test case.

    suite should describe the unit of code that we are testing—this can be a function
    or group of related functionality. In the specifications, you call the global
    Jasmine `it` function to which you pass the title of the specification and test
    function used by the test case. This function is the actual test case. You can
    catch one or more assertions or the general expectations using the `expect` function.
    When all expectations are `true`, your specification is passed. You can write
    any valid JavaScript code in the `describe` and `it` functions. The values that
    you verify as part of the expectations are matched using a matcher. In our example,
    `toEqual()` is the matcher that matches two values for equality. Jasmine contains
    a rich set of matches to suit most of the common use cases. Some common matchers
    supported by Jasmine are as follows:'

    large system, it is not possible to make sure that all systems are always available
    and correct. At the same time, you don''t want your unit tests to fail due to
    a dependency that may be broken or unavailable. To simulate a situation where
    all dependencies are available for a unit of code that we want to test, we mock
    these dependencies to always give the response that we expect. Mocking is an important
    aspect of testing and most testing frameworks provide support for the mocking.
    Jasmine allows mocking using a feature called a spy. Jasmine spies essentially
    stub the functions that we may not have ready; at the time of writing the test
    case but as part of the functionality, we need to track that we are executing
    these dependencies and not ignoring them. Consider the following example:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE9]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In this example, while we are writing this test case, we either don't have the
    real implementation of the `configurator.submitPOSTRequest()` dependency or someone
    is fixing this particular dependency. In any case, we don't have it available.
    For our test to work, we need to mock it. Jasmine spies allow us to replace a
    function with its mock and track its execution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case, we need to ensure that we called the dependency. When the actual
    dependency is ready, we will revisit this test case to make sure that it fits
    the specifications, but at this time, all that we need to ensure is that the dependency
    is called. The Jasmine `tohaveBeenCalled()` function lets us track the execution
    of a function, which may be a mock. We can use `toHaveBeenCalledWith()` that allows
    us to determine if the stub function was called with the correct parameters. There
    are several other interesting scenarios that you can create using Jasmine spies.
    The scope of this chapter won't permit us to cover them all, but I would encourage
    you to discover these areas on your own.

    amount of time debugging your or someone else's code. Debugging is almost like
    an art form. Every language has different methods and challenges around debugging.
    JavaScript has traditionally been a difficult language to debug. I have personally
    spent days and nights of misery trying to debug badly-written JavaScript code
    using `alert()` functions. Fortunately, modern browsers such as Mozilla Firefox
    and Google Chrome have excellent developer tools to help debug JavaScript in the
    browser. There are IDEs like **IntelliJ WebStorm** with great debugging support
    for JavaScript and Node.js. In this chapter, we will focus primarily on Google
    Chrome's built-in developer tool. Firefox also supports the Firebug extension
    and has excellent built-in developer tools, but as they behave more or less the

    debugging approaches that work in both of these tools.

    to handle such exceptional scenarios correctly in the code. While exception handling
    can help prevent crashes, they also aid in debugging. You can wrap the code that
    *may* encounter a runtime exception in a `try{ }` block. When any code in this
    block generates a runtime exception, a corresponding handler captures it. The
    handler is defined by a `catch(exception){}` block. Let''s clarify this using

    exception occurs (or is thrown), the execution stops in the `try{}` block and
    goes directly to the `catch() {}` handler. The `catch` handler is responsible
    for handling the exceptional scenario. In this case, we are displaying the error
    message on the console for debugging purposes. You can explicitly throw an exception
