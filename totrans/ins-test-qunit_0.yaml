- en: JavaScript was first released about 20 years ago. It had not been taken seriously
    by a wide audience for many years. Today, it is a mature (and the most popular)
    programming language. Whatever is done for the Web, one way or another, relies
    on JavaScript. Furthermore, with the advent of HTML5-related technologies, the
    development focus is shifting even more towards rich internet application architecture.
    That means further expansion of sophisticated scalable solutions based on JavaScript.
    The server-side JavaScript is rapidly gaining its momentum, thereby giving automated
    testing of JavaScript.

    it is quite powerful and flexible to be a good choice for unit and functional
    testing of any scale projects.
