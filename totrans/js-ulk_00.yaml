    time of browser wars. It was neglected and misunderstood for a decade and endured
    six editions. And look at it now! JavaScript has become a mainstream programming
    language. It has advanced literally everywhere: in large-scale client-side development,
    server scripting, desktop applications, native mobile programming, game development,
    DB querying, hardware control, and OS automating. JavaScript acquired a number
    of subsets such as Objective-J, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, and others. JavaScript
    is marvelously concise and an expressive language. It features prototype-based
    OOP, object composition and inheritance, variadic functions, event-driven programming,
    and non-blocking I/O. However, to exploit the true power of JavaScript, we need
    to have a deep understanding of language quirks. Moreover, while developing in
    JavaScript, we will become aware of its numerous pitfalls, and we will need a
    few tricks to avoid them. The project formerly known as EcmaScript Harmony, was
    just recently finalized in the specification named EcmaScript 2015, which is more
    often referred to as ES6\. This not only brought the language to the next level,
    but also introduced a number of new technologies that require attention.'

- en: This book aims to guide the reader in understanding the upcoming and existing
    features of JavaScript. It is fully packed with code recipes that address common
    programming tasks. The tasks are supplied with solutions for classical JavaScript
    (ES5) as well as for the next generation language (ES6-7). The book doesn't focus
    only on in-browser language, but also provides the essentials on writing efficient
    JavaScript for desktop applications, server-side software, and native module apps.
    The ultimate goal of the author is not just to describe the language, but also
    to help the reader to improve their code for better maintainability, readability,
    and performance.

    "Chapter 1. Diving into the JavaScript Core"), *Diving into the JavaScript Core*,
    discusses the techniques to improve the expressiveness of the code, to master
    multi-line strings and templating, and to manipulate arrays and array-like objects.
    The chapter explains how to take advantage of JavaScript prototype without harming
    the readability your code. Further, the chapter introduces the "magic methods"
    of JavaScript and gives a practical example of their use.'

    "Chapter 2. Modular Programming with JavaScript"), *Modular Programming with JavaScript*,
    describes the modularity in JavaScript: what modules are, why they are important,
    the standard approaches for asynchronously and synchronously loaded modules, and
    what ES6 modules are. The chapter shows how CommonJS modules are used in server-side
    JavaScript and how to pre-compile them for in-browser use. It elaborates how asynchronous
    and synchronous approaches can be combined to achieve a better application performance.
    It also explains how one can polyfill ES6 modules for production by the means
    of Babel.js.'

    Object Model (DOM), shows the best practices to minimize browser reflow, and enhance
    application performance while operating with the DOM. The chapter also compares
    two client-server communication models: XHR and Fetch API.'

    browser such as Web Storage, IndexDB, and FileSystem. It introduces Web Components
    and gives a walk-through of the creation of a custom component. The chapter describes
    server-to-browser communication APIs such as SSE and WebSockets.'

    nonblocking nature of JavaScript, elaborates the event loop and the call stack.
    The chapter considers the popular styles of chaining asynchronous calls and handling
    errors. It presents the async/await technique of ES7 and also gives examples of
    running tasks in parallel and in sequence using the Promise API and the Async.js
    library. It describes throttling and debouncing concepts.'

- en: It's enough if you have a modern browser and a text editor to run the examples
    from the book. It maybe helpful, however, to use a browser tool similar to Firefox
    Scratchpad ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad))
    to edit the sample code directly in the browser. The books also contains ES6/ES7
    code examples that rely on features not yet available in browsers. You can run
    these examples in Babel.js's online sandbox available at [https://babeljs.io/repl/](https://babeljs.io/repl/).
