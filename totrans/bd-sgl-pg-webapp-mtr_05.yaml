- en: Since we've made it to this chapter, we should already have a good understanding
    of Meteor's template system and how data synchronization between a server and
    clients works. After digesting this knowledge, let's get back to the fun part
    and make our blog a real website with different pages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might ask, "What do pages do in a single-page app?" The term "single page"
    is a bit confusing, as it doesn't mean that our app consists of only one page.
    It's rather a term derived from the current way of doing things, as there is only
    one page sent down from the server. After that, all the routing and paging happens
    in the browser. There aren't any pages requested from the server itself anymore.
    A better term here would be "client-side web application," though **single page**
    is the current used name.
