- en: The Web evolves very quickly. Technologies come and go, and every couple of
    years, new ideas emerge and become widely popular, only to be replaced by something
    else after a while.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’ve been doing web development for many years, chances are you’ve seen
    this cycle go on. Things such as Prototype, and then jQuery, were widely popular
    in the mid-2000s, and are still used on many projects nowadays.

- en: Then, with the performance of browsers and JavaScript engines getting better
    and better, the last decade or so have seen the emergence of many full-blown,
    JavaScript-based frontend frameworks such as Angular and Durandal. More recently,
    modern frameworks based on different concepts or paradigms such as React and Polymer
    have gained a lot of popularity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aurelia is such a modern framework. The brainchild of Rob Eisenberg, the father
    of Durandal, it is based on cutting edge Web standards, and is built on modern
    software architecture concepts and ideas, to offer a powerful toolset and an awesome
    developer experience.
