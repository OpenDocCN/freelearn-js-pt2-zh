- en: Welcome to *Mastering JavaScript High Performance*. In this book, we have covered
    JavaScript performance in a way that helps any JavaScript developer, whether they
    are new to the language or are experienced veterans. This book covers common performance
    bottlenecks, how to look for performance issues within code, and how to correct
    them easily.

- en: We also review modern ways of optimizing our JavaScript code not just by relying
    on sheer knowledge of JavaScript, but by using tools to help optimize code for
    us. These tools include Gulp and Node.js, which help create great performing builds,
    and Jasmine, a JavaScript unit-testing framework that helps discover application
    flow issues in JavaScript. We also debug a hybrid app using Apple Xcode debugging
    tools for HTML and JavaScript.

- en: For this book, you will need a basic understanding of JavaScript, how to write
    functions and variables in JavaScript, how to use basic web technologies such
    as HTML and CSS, as well as some basic debugging skills using a Web Inspector
    such as Chrome Developer tools or Firebug, to name a few.

- en: You will need a text editor, preferably for HTML and JavaScript coding; the
    available choices are covered in [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. The Need for
    Speed"), *The Need for Speed*. Choosing the editor and the admin rights to the
    system you're working on is up to you, and it also depends on your budget. Also,
    [Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Optimizing JavaScript for iOS Hybrid Apps"),
    *Optimizing JavaScript for iOS Hybrid Apps*, strictly covers JavaScript in iOS
    development; for that, you will need a copy of Xcode and an Intel-based Mac. If
    you don't have these, you can still read along but, ideally, most of this work
    is done with a Mac.

- en: This book is written for intermediate JavaScript developers. If you are experienced
    with unit-testing JavaScript and writing your own frameworks, and are able to
    understand what instance-based versus static-based is in JavaScript, this book
    may not be for you. Also, if you're very new to JavaScript—as in, "How do I use
    a function?"—I recommend looking for a beginner's JavaScript book as well.

    performance testing, grunt or gulp project deployments, and unit-testing in JavaScript,
    or if you want to know more on how to write JavaScript faster, or if you're just
    looking to stop your code base from lagging behind without reworking your coding
    style, you are reading the right book.
