- en: 'JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) has rapidly become the lingua franca for
    structured document exchange on the Web, outpacing XML in many domains. Three
    of the reasons for this are obvious: it plays well with JavaScript, it''s simple,
    and it just works. However, there are other reasons for its success as well. As
    you''ll see in the pages of this book, it''s supported by a wide variety of languages
    and libraries, making it easy to use in all kinds of scenarios.'

- en: In this book, I provide recipes for common uses of JSON. You're welcome to read
    the book from cover to cover, seeing all the ways JSON can be used in building
    web and standalone applications. However, it's organized as a cookbook, so that
    you can quickly go to the chapter or recipe that addresses a particular problem
    you might want to solve with JSON now. I recommend skimming this preface to see
    what's where, taking a quick look at [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Reading
    and Writing JSON on the Client"), *Reading and Writing JSON on the Client*, or
    [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Reading and Writing JSON on the Server"), *Reading
    and Writing JSON on the Server*, depending on your interest, and then jumping
    right to the recipes that interest you the most.

    *Reading and Writing JSON on the Server*, goes the other way, looking at JSON
    on typical server-side languages such as Clojure, C#, Node.js, PHP, and Ruby.
    Of course, you can write client-side applications with these languages, as well,
    just as you can write a server in C# or Java. So the division of recipes between
    these chapters is somewhat arbitrary; pick a language and dive in!'

- en: Unlike many other technical books, this one focuses on a wide variety of supporting
    technologies in its examples. I don't expect that you'll have experience or the
    tools to try every example in this book, especially right away. However, it's
    helpful to have a few things set out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should have some programming experience, preferably in JavaScript. Unless
    a recipe is targeted at a specific programming language such as C#, the recipes
    in this book are written in JavaScript. I do this for two reasons. Firstly because
    the "J" in JSON stands for JavaScript (even though it's widely applicable to other
    languages), and, in this day and age, every programmer should have at least a
    nodding familiarity of JavaScript.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As far as software environments go, to begin with, you should have access to
    a good web browser such as Chrome or a recent version of Safari, Firefox, or Internet
    Explorer. You can use the JavaScript runtime in any of these browsers to experiment
    with JSON and get started.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, a lot of the client-server examples feature Node.js. I picked Node.js
    for server-side example programming because it's also JavaScript, meaning that
    you don't have to jump through different language syntaxes as you move between
    the client and server. Node.js runs well on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, too,
    so you shouldn't have a problem setting it up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're interested in using JSON with databases, CouchDB or MongoDB are your
    best choices and I discuss both of them in this book. Which one you choose is
    really a matter of your domain and personal preference. I've been using MongoDB
    for 5 years on various projects but have recently taken a liking to some of CouchDB's
    features and its integrated support for RESTful services.

- en: Finally, if you're a Microsoft developer, you may want to take special note
    of the C# examples that use Newtonsoft's Json.NET throughout this book. Json.NET
    is what JSON in C# ought to be, and it's definitely worth your attention.

- en: If you're writing applications that move structured data from one place to another,
    this book is for you. This is especially true if you've been using XML to do the
    job because it's entirely possible that you could do much of the same work with
    less code and less data overhead in JSON.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the book's chapters make some distinction between the client and server
    sides of an application, it doesn't matter if you're a frontend, backend, or full-stack
    developer. The principles behind using JSON apply to both the client and the server,
    and in fact, developers who understand both sides of the equation generally craft
    the best applications.
