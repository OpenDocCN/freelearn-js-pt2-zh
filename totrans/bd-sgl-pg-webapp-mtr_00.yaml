- en: Thank you for buying this book. You made a great choice for a new step in frontend
    and JavaScript technology. The Meteor framework is not just another library that
    aims to make things easier. It is a complete solution for a web server, client
    logic, and templates. Additionally, it contains a complete build process, which
    will make working for the Web by chunks faster. Thanks to Meteor, linking your
    scripts and styles is a thing of the past, as the automatic build process takes
    care of everything for you. Surely, this is a big change, but you will soon love
    it, as it makes extending your app as fast as creating a new file.

    It takes care of the data synchronization and updating of the DOM. If data changes,
    your screen will be updated. These two basic concepts make up a lot of the work
    we do as web developers, and with Meteor this happens without any extra line of
    code.

    way of doing things where so much time goes only into preparing the app's structure
    while linking files or wrapping them into Require.js modules, writing endpoints,
    and writing code to request and send data back and forth.

- en: While reading this book, you will be introduced step by step to these concepts
    and how they connect together. We will build a blog, with the backend to edit
    posts. A blog is a good example, as it uses listings of posts, different routes
    for each post, and an admin interface to add new posts, providing all we need
    to fully understand Meteor.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To follow the examples in the chapters, you will need a text editor to write
    the code. I highly recommend Sublime Text as your IDE, as it has a wide range
    of plugins for almost every task a web developer could think of.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will also need a modern browser to see your results. As many examples use
    the browser console to make changes to the database and to see the results of
    the code snippets, I recommend Google Chrome. Its Developer tools web inspector
    has everything a web developer needs to work and debug websites with ease.

    the way and in order to go back to the previous versions of your code.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for web developers who want to get into the new paradigm of single-page,
    real-time applications. You don't need to be a JavaScript professional to follow
    along, but certainly a good basic understanding will make this book a valuable
    companion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have heard about Meteor but haven't yet used it, this book is definitely
    for you. It will teach you everything you need to understand and use Meteor successfully.
    If you have used Meteor before but want to get a deeper insight, then the final
    chapter will help you improve your understanding of custom reactive objects and
    writing packages. Testing is probably the least covered topic in the Meteor community
    right now, so by reading the final chapter, you will easily gain an understanding
    of how to make your apps robust using automated tests.
