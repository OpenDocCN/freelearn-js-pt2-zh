    recording is growing at an amazing rate. Every few years the data storage company
    EMC produces a report on just how much data is being preserved ([http://www.emc.com/collateral/analyst-reports/idc-the-digital-universe-in-2020.pdf](http://www.emc.com/collateral/analyst-reports/idc-the-digital-universe-in-2020.pdf)).
    In 2012, it was estimated that between 2005 and 2020 the amount of data stored
    globally will grow from 130 to 40, 000 exabytes. That works out at 5.2 terabytes
    for each person on the planet. It is such a staggering amount of information that
    understanding how much of it exists is difficult. By 2020, it will work out to
    11 spindles of 100 DVDs per person. If we switch to Blu-ray discs, which have
    a capacity of 50 GB, the stack of them required to store all 40, 000 Exabytes
    would still reach far beyond the orbit of the moon.

    adoption of smartphones has turned everybody into a photographer. **Instagram**,
    a popular image sharing site, gathers some 40 million photos a day. One wonders
    how many photos of people's meals the world really needs. In the past few months
    there has been an explosion of video clip sharing sites such as Vine and Instagram,
    which generate massive amounts of data. A myriad of devices are being created
    to extend the reach of smartphones beyond gathering photographic data. The latest
    generation of smartphones include temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors
    in addition to the commonplace GPS, gyroscopic, geomagnetic, and acceleration
    sensors. These allow for recording an accurate representation of the world around
    the user.

    The price of sensors and radios has reached a tipping point where it is economical
    to create standalone devices that record and transmit data about the world. There
    was a time when building an array of temperature sensors that report back to a
    central device was the realm of large SCADA systems. One of my first jobs was
    testing a collection of IP-enabled monitoring devices at a refinery. At the time,
    the network hardware alone was worth millions. That same system can be built for
    a few hundred dollars now. A trip to a crowdsourcing site such as Kickstarter
    or Indiegogo will find countless Bluetooth or Wi-Fi enabled sensor devices. These
    devices may find your lost keys or tell you when to water your tomatoes. A huge
    number of them exist, which suggests that we're entering into an age of autonomous
    devices reporting about the world. A sort of Internet of things is emerging.

    information to reveal a kernel of information. At the same time, great visualizations
    have a degree of beauty to them. Don't be fooled into thinking that this beauty
    serves no purpose. In a world of ever shortening attention spans, there is still

    like extracting, meaning that it is an opinionated process, that's because it

    and your manipulations sufficiently trivial, you may be able to do your preprocessing

    particularly well. Simply looking at the length of the help index for Microsoft
    Excel should tell you that Excel falls solidly into the category of multi-functional
    tools. You can do your accounting with Excel or track how quickly you can run
    a 5K; you can even build graphs with that data. But what you can't do is build
    really good graphs. For that, you're going to need specialized tools with a narrower

    media site, the primary purpose of the site must be to enable the interactions

    story often becomes the story instead of simply providing a meta-story. Many commentators

    of interesting data. I can think of very little that is as compelling as a source

    animals so we have a built-in interest in what is happening in our social circles.
    In addition to their websites, many social media sites have APIs that promote
    building applications that use their data. The theory is that if they can enable
    an ecosystem for their valuable data, people are far more likely to visit their
    site frequently and third-party applications may even draw in new users.

    having found the amount of data with which they have to deal, to be too large
    for traditional databases. Fortunately, there is little need to work with the
    full scale of social data. Narrower sets of data can be accessed through the various
    data access APIs. The key is to shift as much of the filtering and aggregation
    to the social media sites as possible. By exploring the available information,
    it is possible to draw interesting conclusions and expose information through

    opening up the camera, GPS, and filesystem to JavaScript applications. HTML5 can
