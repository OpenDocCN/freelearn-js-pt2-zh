    in social media, data processing, and web technologies has enabled a fusion of

    about exotic topics. The beauty that is inherited in data can be exposed in a
    fashion that is accessible to the masses. Visualizations such as the following

    EMC produces a report on just how much data is being preserved ([http://www.emc.com/collateral/analyst-reports/idc-the-digital-universe-in-2020.pdf](http://www.emc.com/collateral/analyst-reports/idc-the-digital-universe-in-2020.pdf)).
    In 2012, it was estimated that between 2005 and 2020 the amount of data stored
    globally will grow from 130 to 40, 000 exabytes. That works out at 5.2 terabytes
    for each person on the planet. It is such a staggering amount of information that
    understanding how much of it exists is difficult. By 2020, it will work out to
    11 spindles of 100 DVDs per person. If we switch to Blu-ray discs, which have
    a capacity of 50 GB, the stack of them required to store all 40, 000 Exabytes
    would still reach far beyond the orbit of the moon.

    was a time when building an array of temperature sensors that report back to a
    central device was the realm of large SCADA systems. One of my first jobs was
    testing a collection of IP-enabled monitoring devices at a refinery. At the time,
    the network hardware alone was worth millions. That same system can be built for
    a few hundred dollars now. A trip to a crowdsourcing site such as Kickstarter
    or Indiegogo will find countless Bluetooth or Wi-Fi enabled sensor devices. These
    devices may find your lost keys or tell you when to water your tomatoes. A huge

  zh: 从可视化的角度来看，社交媒体是有趣数据的一个巨大来源。我想象不出有什么数据源比人与人之间的社交互动更有吸引力。人类进化成社交动物，所以我们天生对发生在我们的社交圈内的事情感兴趣。除了它们的网站，许多社交媒体网站还有API，促进构建使用它们数据的应用程序。理论上是，如果它们能为它们有价值的数据启用一个生态系统，人们会更频繁地访问它们的网站，第三方应用程序甚至可能会吸引新用户。
- en: Social media is the very definition of Big Data. Facebook has something like
    a billion users, each of which may generate a dozen pieces of data a day. Twitter,
    LinkedIn, and Facebook have all created their own database technologies after
    having found the amount of data with which they have to deal, to be too large
    for traditional databases. Fortunately, there is little need to work with the
    full scale of social data. Narrower sets of data can be accessed through the various
    data access APIs. The key is to shift as much of the filtering and aggregation
    to the social media sites as possible. By exploring the available information,
    it is possible to draw interesting conclusions and expose information through
    visualizations that aren't typically apparent to users.

  zh: 社交媒体是大数据的定义。Facebook有大约十亿用户，每个用户可能每天产生十几条数据。Twitter、LinkedIn和Facebook在发现他们需要处理的数据量太大，超出了传统数据库的承载能力后，都创建了自己的数据库技术。幸运的是，很少需要处理社交媒体的全部数据。通过各种数据访问API，可以访问更窄的数据集。关键是尽可能将筛选和聚合工作转移到社交媒体网站上。通过探索可用的信息，可以得出有趣的结论，并通过可视化手段揭示用户通常不易察觉的信息。

- en: The final piece in the puzzle is HTML5\. When I was young, a new version of
    HTML meant another long-winded specification from the World Wide Web consortium.
    The specification process for a new version of HTML would take several years and
    would be planned out by a committee with members from large technical organizations
    such as Microsoft and IBM. While there is an HTML5 specification, it is not as
    formal as previous iterations. The term HTML5 has come to describe a collection
    of future-oriented technologies that can be used to create powerful web applications.

    on browsers, but also on mobile devices and on the desktop. Through toolkits such
    as PhoneGap ([http://phonegap.com/](http://phonegap.com/)), HTML and Microsoft's
    WinJS JavaScript can be used as primary development languages on iPhones, Android,
    Windows Phone, and even Blackberry. The native APIs are bound to JavaScript equivalents
    opening up the camera, GPS, and filesystem to JavaScript applications. HTML5 can
    also be used as a development platform for Windows 8-style applications (previously
    known as Metro). On non-Windows platforms, desktop applications can be developed
    in HTML5 using a toolkit-like Adobe Air ([http://www.adobe.com/products/air.html](http://www.adobe.com/products/air.html)).
    HTML5 offers a multi-platform development environment that allows taking skills
    from the Web to tablet to desktop.

    JavaScript可以作为iPhone、Android、Windows Phone甚至黑莓手机的主要开发语言。原生API被绑定到JavaScript等效物上，使得JavaScript应用程序能够打开摄像头、GPS和文件系统。HTML5还可以用作Windows
    8风格应用程序（以前称为Metro）的开发平台。在非Windows平台上，可以使用类似于Adobe Air([http://www.adobe.com/products/air.html](http://www.adobe.com/products/air.html))的工具包来用HTML5开发桌面应用程序。HTML5提供了一个多平台开发环境，允许将Web技能带到平板电脑和桌面上。

    content to your application. Embedding data directly on the client machine instead
    of having to pull it down repeatedly from a server allows for applications to
    be truly mobile—the network is no longer crucial.

- en: HTML5 has been hugely beneficial to visualization developers. Canvas and SVG
    both offer enticing functionalities. CSS3 also allows for a greater degree of
    flexibility around styling. Before HTML5 came onto the scene, interactive data
    visualizations in a browser could best be achieved using third-party tools such
    as Java Applets or Adobe Flash. The adoption rates for these technologies, while
    high, still cut off a large number of users. Even with high adoption rates, the
    versions of these tools being run in the wild were frequently archaic. Neither
    Java Applets, nor Adobe Flash is available on the increasingly popular mobile
    platforms. HTML5, on the other hand, is now supported in some form on the vast
    majority of smart phones.

  zh: HTML5 对可视化开发者来说非常有益。Canvas 和 SVG 都提供了诱人的功能。CSS3 也允许在样式上具有更大的灵活性。在 HTML5 出现之前，要在浏览器中实现交互式数据可视化，最好的方法是使用
    Java Applets 或 Adobe Flash 等第三方工具。尽管这些技术的采用率很高，但仍然排除了一大批用户。即使采用率高，这些工具在野外的版本也往往是过时的。Java
    Applets 或 Adobe Flash 都不支持越来越受欢迎的移动平台。另一方面，HTML5 在大多数智能手机上以某种形式得到支持。
- en: One of the best features of developing a visualization in HTML is that it is
    possible to allow users to interact with the visualization. Famous visualizations
    such as the *London Underground Map* have been crippled by being drawn on a static
    piece of paper. Interactions provide a whole new level of user engagement—previously
    impossible. It should not surprise you if users of interactive visualizations
    find ways to manipulate the visualization to derive whole new conclusions.

- en: Communicating information to users is tricky. The problem is compounded by the
    huge quantity of data that is now available at the click of a mouse or the punch
    of a key. As a visualization developer, it is your role to sort through clouds
    of irrelevant data to extract the bits in which you're interested and then to
    present that data to your users in an interesting way. People are interested in
    data, but they are rarely interested in sorting through reams of tabular data.
    Visualizations are frequently the best tools for presenting that data to your
    users.
