    allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, protocol, or port) than
    its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS also relies
    on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting
    the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual
    request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method
    and headers that will be used in the actual request."'

    your API (using the `OPTIONS` method), and the response to this request will not

    the request to fail and the browser to prevent further requests.'

    basic security practices, adding the CORS mechanism and HTTPS to the API. These
    two features, which are pretty much standard in any application, are a big security
    improvement on what we already had.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, thinking about deploying the application, we also abstracted the configuration
    and secrets from the code base. We started by creating an abstraction that would
    deal with it so that the configuration is not scattered, and modules just receive
    their configuration values without any awareness of how they're loaded. Then,
    we proceeded to using those values in our current code base, something that revealed
    itself to be quite easy. This step removed any configuration values from the code
    and moved them to a configuration file.
