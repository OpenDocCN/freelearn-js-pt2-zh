- en: JavaScript is an important part of web development in today's Web 2.0 world.
    Although there are many JavaScript frameworks in the market, learning to write,
    test, and debug JavaScript without the help of any framework will make you a better
    JavaScript developer. However, testing and debugging can be time-consuming, tedious
    and painful. This book will ease your woes by providing various testing strategies,
    advice, and tool guides that will make testing smooth and easy.

- en: This book is organized in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step tutorial style, in
    order to maximize your learning. You will first learn about the different types
    of errors that you will most often encounter as a JavaScript developer. You will
    also learn the most essential features of JavaScript through our easy-to-follow
    examples.

- en: As you go along, you will learn how to write better JavaScript code through
    validation; learning how to write validated code alone will help you improve tremendously
    as a JavaScript developer and, most importantly, help you to write JavaScript
    code that runs better, faster, and with less bugs.

- en: As our JavaScript program gets larger, we need better ways of testing our JavaScript
    code. You will learn about various testing concepts and how to use them in your
    test plan. After which, you will learn how to implement the test plan for your
    code. To accommodate more complex JavaScript code, you will learn more about the
    built-in features of JavaScript, in order to identify and catch different types
    of JavaScript error; such information helps to spot the root of the problem so
    that you can act on it.

    external tools to automate your testing process.

    *Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript*, covers why we perform ad hoc testing
    for our JavaScript programs, and JavaScript''s most commonly-used features, by
    writing a simple program, This program will be used as an example to perform ad
    hoc testing.'

    the point where our code gets too large and complex to be tested by using manual
    methods. We now engage the help of debugging tools provided by popular browsers
    in the market, including Internet Explorer 8, FireFox 3.6, Chrome 5.0, Safari
    4.0 and Opera 10.'
