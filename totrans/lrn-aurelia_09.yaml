    often gives some sense of fluidity, and a well-used animation can be the best
    way to communicate something to the user, more so than icons, images, or yet another

    with an animator service to perform view transitions. By default, it uses a class
    named `Animator`, which acts as a null object and, incidentally, describes the
    expected interface of an `Animator`.

    an element using a CSS class that doesn't define any animation.

    limited to calling the `enter` method for an element when adding it to the DOM

    used by the framework, but will be by our own code.

    will call `enter` when rendering an element, and `leave` when removing it from
    the DOM, only if the element has the `au-animate` CSS class. This is for performance
    reasons; without this opt-in mechanism, a lot of useless code would be executed
    every time any element is rendered and unrendered, when typically, only a few
    selected elements have animated transitions.

    in the previous section, the element is first attached to the DOM, meaning that
    the `attached` callback is called at the same time, then the animator checks for
    the `au-animate` CSS class. If the `attached` callback synchronously sets `animated`
    to `true`, the `au-animate` CSS class will be present on the element when the
    animator checks if it needs to be animated, and the items will be animated during
    their initial rendering, which we want to prevent. Instead, we push the setting
    of `animated` to `true` on the browser's event queue, so the component's rendering
    is completed when the `au-animate` CSS class is added to the item's `div` elements.

- en: For example, if the effect you want to implement when navigating from one route
    to another is to see the new view slide in from the right while the old view slides
    out to the left, you'll want the animation of the old view's removal and the animation
    of the new view's addition to run simultaneously, so you'll want to use the `with`
    swap strategy.

  zh: 例如，如果你在从一个路由跳转到另一个路由时希望看到新视图从右侧滑入，而旧视图向左滑出，那么你需要旧视图的移除动画和新视图的添加动画同时运行，因此你需要使用`with`交换策略。

  zh: 为Aurelia应用程序添加动画相当简单。基于CSS的实现允许您轻松快速地为现有应用程序添加动画。
- en: When the need for more complex animations arises, an adapter plugin over your
    favorite animation library can be easily written if it doesn't exist. At the time
    of writing, the official Aurelia libraries comprise `aurelia-velocity`, an adapter
    plugin for the popular `velocity.js` library. I'm sure that the community will
    eventually come up with adapters for other animation solutions, so I strongly
    suggest you keep an eye on it.

  zh: 当需要更复杂的动画时，如果它不存在，可以很容易地编写您最喜欢的动画库的适配器插件。在撰写本文时，官方Aurelia库包括`aurelia-velocity`，它是流行的`velocity.js`库的适配器插件。我确信社区最终会提出其他动画解决方案的适配器，所以我强烈建议您密切关注它。
