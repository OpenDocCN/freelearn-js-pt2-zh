- en: It would seem that everything that needs to be written about JavaScript has
    been written. Frankly, it is difficult to find a topic related to JavaScript that
    has not been discussed ad nauseam. However, JavaScript is changing at a rapid
    pace. ECMAScript 6 has the potential to transform the language and how we code
    in it. Node.js has already changed the way in which we write servers in JavaScript.
    Newer ideas such as React and Flux will drive the next iteration of the language.
    While we spend our time learning the new features, there is no denying that the
    foundational ideas of JavaScript have to be mastered. These ideas are fundamental
    and need attention. If you are already an experienced JavaScript developer, you
    will realize that modern JavaScript is vastly different from the language that
    most people have known. Modern JavaScript demands a specific stylistic discipline
    and rigor of thought. Tools are more powerful and slowly becoming an integral
    part of the development workflow. Though the language seems to be changing, it
    is built on some very solid and constant ideas. This book emphasizes on these
    fundamental ideas.

    "Chapter 1. JavaScript Primer"), *JavaScript Primer*, focuses on the language
    constructs without spending too much time on the basic details. We will cover
    the trickier parts of variable scoping and loops and best practices for using
    types and data structures. We will also cover a lot of ground on the coding style
    and recommended code organization patterns.'

    "Chapter 2. Functions, Closures, and Modules"), *Functions, Closures and Modules*,
    covers the core of the language intricacies. We will discuss the complexities
    involved in using functional aspects with different treatment for closures in
    JavaScript. This is a careful and elaborate discussion that will prepare you to
    explore more advanced design patterns further on.'

    "Chapter 3. Data Structures and Manipulation"), *Data Structures and Manipulation*,
    takes a detailed look at regular expressions and arrays. Arrays are a fundamental
    data type in JavaScript and this chapter will help you work effectively with arrays.
    Regular expressions can make your code concise—we will take a detailed look at
    how to use RegEx effectively in your code.'

    "Chapter 4. Object-Oriented JavaScript"), *Object-Oriented JavaScript*, discusses
    object orientation in JavaScript. We will discuss inheritance and the prototype
    chain and focus on understanding the prototypal inheritance model that JavaScript
    offers. We will also discuss how different this model is from other object-oriented
    models to help Java or C++ programmers get familiarized with the change.'

    "Chapter 5. JavaScript Patterns"), *JavaScript Patterns*, discusses common design
    patterns and how to implement them in JavaScript. Once you master the object-oriented
    model for JavaScript, it is easier to understand design and programming patterns
    to write modular and easy-to-maintain code.'

    methods to test and debug issues in JavaScript code. We will also explore continuous
    testing and test-driven methodologies for JavaScript. We will use Jasmine as the
    test framework.'
